OpenCV 2.3 Image Histogram Sample Program
=========================================
A simple example program using OpenCV 2.3 that calculates a histogram of
the pixels in an image in a not-terribly-efficient manner.

Setup
-----
Install OpenCV 2.3.1 on your machine.

Usage
-----

    $ make
    $ ./hist
    All tests passed
    
The code should also compile with Visual Studio, if you prefer, although 
this is currently untested (please report any problems).
